    <h1>stoNe gaMe</h1>
    <p>
      The goblinS have invented a game that, in their language, is impossible
      for us to pronounce, but, in English, is called the stoNe gaMe. The two
      best gobliN players of all of the goblinS who play the stoNe gaMe are unK
      and glooB. The game is played by setting up 3 piles of stones. Each pile
      has 3 stones in it. On your turn, you can take any number of stones from
      any pile you like. If you take the last stone from the last pile, you lose
      the game. <br /><br />
      To play, click on the pile of your choice. Then, click the button with the
      number of stones you wish to take, then press the take button. The stones
      will disappear, and the game will send messages in the dialogue box at the
      bottom of the screen.
